# CalculatorC

This is the first programming project that I ever made in a text-based programming language as opposed to a block-based programming language like MIT App Inventor. It is a text-based calculator that can do simple addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. I made this using what I learned from the EPHS programming club.
